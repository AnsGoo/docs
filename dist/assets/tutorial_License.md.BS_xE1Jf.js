<span class="line"><span>      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span></span>

<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>          the Derivative Works; and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      the conditions stated in this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span></span>
